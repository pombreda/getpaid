**Creating Content Buyable Content for GetPaid**

This document assumes you have already set up a Plone site with
GetPaid. If you haven't, please read setup.txt

Now you need to make content buyable, donatable or shippable.

To do this, go to the "site setup" section of your site when viewed
through the Plone interface and click on "GetPaid" in the "Add-on
Product Configuration" section. 

Here, click on the "Content Types" sub-section and use
the arrows to move any appropriate content types to the "Selected"
column on the right of the Buyable, Donatable or Shippable sections.

The differences are explained below:

- Buyable

  Buyable content is anything that can be bought that doesn't fall
  into another category.

  Content selected to be buyable will have a "make buyable"
  action available. Performing this action will add a "payable" view
  to the content where the Product Code and Price of this item can be
  entered. 

  The Product Code is an optional internal code for the product as
  used by the organisation selling it.

  The Price is the price to charge for each item of this type that is
  sold. 

  Once a price has been entered, viewing the content will show a
  "Product Details" portlet which allow end users to add the product
  to their cart.

- Donatable

  xxx Donatable doesn't appear to differ from Buyable functionally
  apart from one text field, which arguably Buyable should also have.

  This will mean content of the selected types has a 
  "make this a donation" action available. Performing this action will
  add a "payable" view to the content where the Product Code, Price
  and Donation Description of this item can be entered. 

  The Product Code is an optional internal code used to refer to the
  item to which money can be donated as used by the organisation
  making it available.

  The Price is the donation required for the item. 

  The Donation Description is a textual description that will show up
  in the Product Details portlet when this content is viewed.

  Once a price has been entered, viewing the content will show a
  "Product Details" portlet which allow end users to add the product
  to their cart.

- Shippable

  Any content type that represents something that can be physcially
  shipped to a customer should be marked as Shippable.

  This will mean content of the selected types has a 
  "make shippable product" action available. Performing this action will
  add a "payable" view to the content where the Product Code, Price,
  Dimensions, Product SKU and Shipping Weight of this item can be entered. 

  The Product Code is an optional internal code used to refer to the
  item to which money can be donated as used by the organisation
  making it available.

  The Price is the donation required for the item. 

  xxx what unit is dimensions in? what is it used for?

  xxx why have a seperate Stock Keeping Unit? What's wrong with the
  Product Code?!

  The Shipping Weight lets you specify the value and units for the
  weight of the content.

  xxx what is shipping weight used for?

  To use shippables, you must have a shipping method configured or the
  checkout will not function.

In addition to making existing content types buyable, donatable or
shippable, content types can be specifically created to be of these
types. The following example shows how to do this:

from Products.Archetypes.public import BaseContent,registerType
from Products.PloneGetPaid.interfaces import IBuyableMarker
from Products.PloneGetPaid.interfaces import IDonatableMarker
from Products.PloneGetPaid.interfaces import IShippableMarker
from zope.interface import implements

class MyBuyable(BaseContent):
   implements(IBuyableMarker)
registerType(MyBuyable)

class MyDonatable(BaseContent):
   implements(IBuyableMarker)
registerType(MyDonatable)

class MyShippable(BaseContent):
   implements(IBuyableMarker)
registerType(MyShippable)
