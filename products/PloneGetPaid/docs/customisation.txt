**Customising a GetPaid Site**

This document assumes you have already set up a Plone site with
GetPaid. If you haven't, please read setup.txt

Most functionality and features of GetPaid can be easily
customized. To do so, you should be familiar with the Zope 3 Component
Architecture.

By writing your own adapters for GetPaid, you use a custom way of
storing member data (ie a relational database), handling pricing (to
implement specific discounting options, for example), introducing new
payment processors, and much more.

Documentation on GetPaid customization best practices is available
