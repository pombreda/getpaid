Order Management in GetPaid
===========================

Getpaid's core functionality is represented as an order management
system. 

Creating an Order
=================

  >>> from getpaid.core.order import Order
  >>> order = Order()

Carts and Line Items
====================

An order consists of line items. line items can come from a variety of
sources, content space payables, gift certificates, ie. anything we 
potentially want to purchase:

  >>> from getpaid.core.item import LineItem
  >>> item = LineItem()
  
Let's set some attributes expected on line items. The only system invariant
here is that item_id should be unique when referring to purchasing the same
item: 

  >>> item.item_id = "event-devtalk-2007-1" 
  >>> item.name = "Event Registration"
  >>> item.cost = 25.00
  >>> item.quantity = 5
  >>> item.description = "Development Talk"
  
Line Items are stored in a line item container, such as a shopping cart
of shipment:
  
  >>> from getpaid.core.cart import ShoppingCart
  >>> cart = ShoppingCart()
  >>> cart[ item.item_id ] = item

Let's attach our cart to the order:

  >>> order.shopping_cart = cart

and now we can ask the order, its total price:
  
  >>> order.getSubTotalPrice()
  Decimal("125.0")

[ xxx talk about products and payable line items here ??]

Customer Information
====================

We need some additional information for an order to successfully process it:

  >>> from getpaid.core import payment
  >>> bill_address = payment.BillingAddress()
  >>> bill_address.bill_first_line = '1418 W Street NW'
  >>> bill_address.bill_city = 'Washington'
  >>> bill_address.bill_state = "DC"
  >>> bill_address.bill_country = "US"
  >>> bill_address.bill_postal_code = '20009'
  >>>
  >>> 
  >>> contact_info = payment.ContactInformation()
  >>>
  >>> order.contact_information = contact_info
  >>> order.billing_address = bill_address

If we don't need to ship anything to the user, then we can forgo
setting a shipping address.


Introspection and Classification
================================

When we create an order, an order inspection component which
subscribes to the order created event, gets a chance to look at all
the contents of an order and modify it. The default inspector, will
add additional marker interfaces to the order to classify it based on
its contents as a shippable order, donation order, etc. Based on these
marker interfaces and corresponding compnent registration, we can
specialize adapation of orders to workflows, payment processing as
appropriate for a given order. 

  >>> from zope.app.event.objectevent import ObjectCreatedEvent
  >>> from zope.event import notify
  >>> notify( ObjectCreatedEvent( order ))
  >>> 

Finance Workflow
================

The finance workflow


Payment Processor Integration
=============================  

We payment processor integration to support multiple different
services and is workflow driven. We dispatch workflow events to a
processor integration multi adapter which takes as context the order
and the workflow. 


The one public payment processor integration attribute on the order is
the payment processor id, which corresponds to the name that the
payment processor adapter is registered on.


Its also important to note that there are several varieties of
asynchronous payment processors, which alsorequire corresponding
checkout user interface support, and callback url endpoints, which are
outside of the scope of this example. These doctest examples require a
synchronous processor api.


Managing Collections of Orders
==============================

We have an Order manager with a storage. This storage is an Order catalog
which store the different order and index some part of the order.

  >>> from getpaid.core.cart import ShoppingCart
  >>> cart = ShoppingCart()
  >>> item = LineItem()
  >>> item.item_id = "event-devtalk-2007-1"
  >>> item.name = "Event Registration"
  >>> item.cost = 25.00
  >>> item.quantity = 5
  >>> item.description = "Development Talk"
  >>> cart[ item.item_id ] = item
  >>> from getpaid.core.order import Order
  >>> order1 = Order()
  >>> order1.order_id = '12'
  >>> order1.user_id = 'John'
  >>> order1.shopping_cart = cart
  >>> order1.getSubTotalPrice()
  Decimal("125.0")
  >>> from getpaid.core.order import OrderManager
  >>> from getpaid.core.interfaces import IOrderManager
  >>> from zope.component import getUtility
  >>> manager = getUtility(IOrderManager)
  >>> manager.store(order1)
  >>> manager.get('12')
  <getpaid.core.order.Order object ...>
  >>> manager.get('0') is None
  True
  >>> orders = manager.query(user_id='John')
  >>> len(orders)
  1
  >>> order = orders[0]
  >>> order
  <getpaid.core.order.Order object ...>
  >>> order.order_id
  '12'

Let's try to add another order and try to get a sorted list:

  >>> cart = ShoppingCart()
  >>> item = LineItem()
  >>> item.item_id = "event-devtalk-2007-1"
  >>> item.name = "Event Registration"
  >>> item.cost = 25.00
  >>> item.quantity = 5
  >>> item.description = "Development Talk"
  >>> cart[ item.item_id ] = item
  >>> order2 = Order()
  >>> order2.order_id = '156'
  >>> order2.user_id = 'John'
  >>> order2.shopping_cart = cart
  >>> order2.getSubTotalPrice()
  Decimal("125.0")
  >>> manager.store(order2)
  >>> orders = manager.query(user_id='John')
  >>> len(orders)
  2
  >>> order = orders[1]
  >>> order
  <getpaid.core.order.Order object ...>
  >>> order.order_id
  '12'
  >>> orders = manager.query(user_id='John', no_sort=True)
  >>> len(orders)
  2
  >>> order = list(orders)[1]
  >>> order
  <getpaid.core.order.Order object ...>
  >>> order.order_id
  '156'

Let's try to change the price of an order. The price should be the same as
before in the order manager:
  >>> cart = ShoppingCart()
  >>> item = LineItem()
  >>> item.item_id = "event-devtalk-2007-1"
  >>> item.name = "Event Registration"
  >>> item.cost = 45.00
  >>> item.quantity = 5
  >>> item.description = "Development Talk"
  >>> cart[ item.item_id ] = item
  >>> order3 = Order()
  >>> order3.order_id = '164'
  >>> order3.user_id = 'John'
  >>> order3.shopping_cart = cart
  >>> order3.getSubTotalPrice()
  Decimal("225.0")
  >>> manager.store(order3)
  >>> orders = manager.query(user_id='John')
  >>> len(orders)
  3
  >>> [order.order_id for order in orders]
  ['164', '156', '12']
  >>> order = orders[2]
  >>> order.order_id
  '12'
  >>> order.getSubTotalPrice()
  Decimal("125.0")

Let's try a new order with a different user:

  >>> item.cost = 45.00
  >>> cart = ShoppingCart()
  >>> item = LineItem()
  >>> item.item_id = "event-devtalk-2007-1"
  >>> item.name = "Event Registration"
  >>> item.cost = 25.00
  >>> item.quantity = 5
  >>> item.description = "Development Talk"
  >>> cart[ item.item_id ] = item
  >>> order3 = Order()
  >>> order3.order_id = '167'
  >>> order3.user_id = 'Alice'
  >>> order3.shopping_cart = cart
  >>> manager.store(order3)
  >>> orders = manager.query(user_id='Alice')
  >>> len(orders)
  1

Querying Orders
===============


Reporting on Orders
===================

We use workflows to model the order lifecycle for finance and
fulfillment. We can introspect orders to classify by them interface
and adapt to the appropriate workflows. As a consequence we can support
online and shipping based from the same order management system.
 and support virtual delivery, and a shipping lifecycle. we
utilize hurry.workflow to implement our workflows, one benefits to
make this lifecycle observable via event subscribers.



line items are stored in line item containers, like a shopping cart,
or shipment. a line item is unique within these containers
based on some unique attribute (at uid, or product sku).


getpaid internaly dispatches workflow changes to the appropriate
payment processor for an order.


because we can process workflows asynchronously, we can get pretty
good at synchronization / integration with other systems.

an order has both a finance workflow and a fufillment workflow
dependent on its contained items. the finance workflow models things
like cc authorization for an order, and capture/charging an order.

Workflow Tests
--------------

Let's first create an Order object to work with:

   >>> from getpaid.core.order import Order
   >>> testorder = Order()

Now we'll test the order workflow...

Before we fire the 'create' transition we don't have a workflow states
for finance and fulfillment

   >>> state = testorder.fulfillment_state
   >>> print state
   None

   >>> state = testorder.finance_state
   >>> print state
   None

Firing the 'create' transition in the finance workflow should put us 
in the REVIEWING state
 
   >>> testorder.finance_workflow.fireTransition('create')
   >>> state = testorder.finance_state
   >>> print state
   REVIEWING

Firing some more transitions to test the finance workflow.  

   >>> testorder.finance_workflow.fireTransition('authorize')
   >>> state = testorder.finance_state
   >>> print state
   CHARGEABLE


   >>> testorder.finance_workflow.fireTransition('charge-chargeable')
   >>> state = testorder.finance_state
   >>> print state
   CHARGING

Firing the 'create' transition in the fulfillment workflow should put us 
in the REVIEWING state

   >>> testorder.fulfillment_workflow.fireTransition('create')
   >>> state = testorder.fulfillment_state
   >>> print state
   NEW

Testing the fulfillment workflow for a delivered order. We need to re-cast 
the testorder object as we cannot transition back from 

   >>> testorder = Order()
   >>> testorder.fulfillment_workflow.fireTransition('create')
   >>> state = testorder.fulfillment_state
   >>> print state
   NEW

   >>> testorder.fulfillment_workflow.fireTransition('process-order')
   >>> state = testorder.fulfillment_state
   >>> print state
   PROCESSING

   >>> testorder.fulfillment_workflow.fireTransition('deliver-processing-order')
   >>> state = testorder.fulfillment_state
   >>> print state
   DELIVERED

Testing the fulfillment workflow for a cancelled order. We need to re-cast 
the testorder object as we cannot transition back from DELIVERED state.

   >>> testorder2 = Order()

   >>> testorder2.fulfillment_workflow.fireTransition('create')
   >>> state = testorder2.fulfillment_state
   >>> print state
   NEW

   >>> testorder2.fulfillment_workflow.fireTransition('process-order')
   >>> state = testorder2.fulfillment_state
   >>> print state
   PROCESSING

   >>> testorder2.fulfillment_workflow.fireTransition('cancel-order')
   >>> state = testorder2.fulfillment_state
   >>> print state
   WILL_NOT_DELIVER
