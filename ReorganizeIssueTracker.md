# Introduction #

Currently it is a mess and we aren't using labels very well. Also, not much consistent about the releases. Need to get it much better!

Ideas:
  * Now that we have the repo refactored, do we also need to tag things with components? ie getpaid.core, getpaid.discount, getpaid.salesforce...
  * Google code lets you change the layout of issue tracker to make it easier to read. We could experiment with ways to do that and then change the "Issues" link to point to a particular configuration (note: I am a fan of the grid layout

  * Do we need to tag per Plone version? I think if we branch 2.5 vs 3, then yes...
