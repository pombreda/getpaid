It should be possible to set up the payment processor via the configuration configlet found in Site Setup (in the Addon Product Configuration area). Payment processor is a tab in the configuration screens. 

Configlet options:

Displays a dropdown (single select) list of all possible options for merchant agencies. List of agencies:

    * Authorize.net
    * PayFlowPro
    * GoogleCheckout
    * 2Checkout
    * Future: Need an international option (ZenCart?)
    * Future: PayPal
    * Future: NOVA/viaKLIX


When the site admin selects an option from the list for the payment processor, the corresponding fields for the processor are displayed. The site admin fills out the required settings and then clicks "save". Errors point out any missing, required fields.
