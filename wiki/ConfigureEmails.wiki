          ( ) Send the transaction details in an encrypted email

      Admin can choose to receive encrypted notification of orders on site, to receive a notification that an order was placed (but no data), or no notification. Single select only on the list.

      "Merchant Notification Email": Can specify the email address of the customer or a freetext email address (i.e. customerservice@), a subject field ("an order has been placed"), text field. 



=Payee and Merchant Receive Email Confirmation=

Upon completion of an order / subscription, customers will receive an email confirming their order. Similarly, the merchant will receive an email, according to the preferences set in the configuration panel. The emails can also be customized in that area.

Payment details will be included in the email (i.e. what the user purchased, what they paid, what their login name is). Credit card information will obviously not be included.
