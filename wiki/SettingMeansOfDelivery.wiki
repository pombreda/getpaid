#summary Setting Means of Delivery to be web, shipping, or subscription-based, on a particular content object

= Setting Means of Delivery =

For any content object in the site that has been designated "payable", the site manager can specify the "Deliver by" means via a dropdown in the Content Menu. The options include "Ship", "Web/Service", or "Subscription". If the object is designated as "Ship", this will simply be a boolean object that ties the object to the site-wide shipping settings. For an item that the user would gain access to via the web site after they purchase a single object, ie a research report PDF download, admin would select "Web/Service". For an object that would be a part of a benefit to a "premium site subscription" (for example, a folder that contains articles for paying members), the delivery would be designated "Subscription". (Integrators can add other options, which would become available here and imply the subsequent step.

For any delivery mechanism that required additional information, the site manager would be directed to the edit screen for the content object, which would have a the delivery-specific fields.
