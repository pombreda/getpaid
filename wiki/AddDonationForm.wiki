Site Manager can go anywhere in the site and select a piece of content. Using the actions menu, choose "Make this a donation". Any piece of content can be a donation. Flagging an object as a donation object will add on a schema to allow users to enter the following information:

    * Donation title
    * A rich text area for describing the donation.
    * Product code
    * Price (free text)
    * A submit and clear button.
    * Made payable by (automatically generated)


Customizing Buttons / Labels:

    * Provide an option for changing the buttons: "sign up for an event," "add to cart," "select this child," etc...

    Jon Stahl: Site admins will want to have a rich-text field so they can add arbitrary marketing content to the page.

    Jon Stahl: Site admins will also want the ability to add arbitrary information fields (e.g. checkboxes, radio buttons, text fields).  For example, a checkbox "Subscribe me to your email newsletter."  I suggest figuring out how to take advantage of PloneFormGen to provide this kind of flexibility.
