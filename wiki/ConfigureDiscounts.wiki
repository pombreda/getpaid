= Configure Discounts =

A site manager can enter the Site Setup / GetPaid management area and click on the "Discounts" page to configure discounts. The screen has a section for "Existing Discounts", which lists the discount code, description, and discount amount, with an "edit" and "delete" button next to each row (if there are none, a message displays "No discounts configured at this time."

Below that area is the "Add/Configure Discounts" area, that has a box for "discount code" (with specifications that it should not contain any spaces, not case sensitive), "discount description" (text box for adding a brief description), and "discount amount" (currently only offers a "% off" discount). The form has a "save" and "clear" button next to it.
If the user clicks on "edit" in the existing discount, the values populate in the lower area of the screen, and the browser is directed to that area, allowing for editing. If the user clicks on "delete", a confirmation window pops up "Are you sure you want to delete <discount code> discount?" with "yes, delete" and "no, cancel" options.

==Future Cases==

 Add a "flat rate" option to the discount amount, which also requires specifying currency (if there are multiple currencies in the site).
