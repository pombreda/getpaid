= Comments on the code =

Kapil noted that the multiplepaymentprocessors branch stores some of its settings by using the "self.context.portal_properties" mechanism from Zope 2. This means that his branch moves GetPaid from using a single, modern, Zope 3 mechanism for saving and retrieving its settings — calling getToolByName() — to using two different mechanisms, which means that some settings for GetPaid will be stored in one place, and all of its other settings in another.
