=Configure Shipping=

==Configuring on a Content Object Basis==

Any content object that is marked as Payable will also be able to be Shippable. See Setting Means of Delivery.

==Configuring Site-Wide==

There will be a "shipping" tab in the Site Setup / GetPaid Configuration panel for setting up shipping settings. This is used when the site manager sets the site-wide shipping options to be used.

Note that most of this information is gleaned from Miva Merchant documentation. Some of this information may not be usable for implementation, but might be of use for end user documentation.
For the first iteration of this product, the following options are suggested for implementation:

==Weight Units==
A dropdown box to choose units for weight in the site. Selecting "pounds (lbs)" or "kilograms (Kg)" will provide site-wide settings for interfaces.

===Base + Weight Shipping===

    * Allows you to define a base charge, plus an amount to be charged per weight unit for the total weight of the order. It calculates shipping charges according to a configured Base charge PLUS a configured per unit-of-weight-measure charge, instead of charging a minimum OR per-unit amount. Site manager can edit the fields for "base charge" and "per weight charge".

===Flat Rate Shipping===

    * Defines a flat rate that is to be charged for shipping. This most basic of all of the shipping modules may be given a list of methods that you can assign a name and flat amount for the shipping charge that will be added to the customer's order regardless of any weight data.

===Minimum or Weight Shipping===

    * This shipping type allows you to establish a minimum charge for shipping. You configure a per/unit-of-weight charge and a minimum charge which MIVA Merchant will use to calculate the shipping charges for your customers orders. The weight unit set in the Settings of the Add Store page, and (based on that unit of measure) the weight specified in the product record of each product in your shoppers baskets are used to calculate the shipping charge.
    * Use the following procedure to set up minimum or weight shipping for your store. Enter the name of this Minimum or Weight Shipping Method. Enter the charge for each Unit of Measurement (Weight). Do not enter the currency symbol. (The Unit of Measurement is listed under Settings on the Edit Store page.) Enter the minimum charge for this shipping Module to charge if the total weight of items in a basket is less than the per-unit charge.  

===Price Table Based Shipping===

    * Fields include: Add Shipping Method (i.e. a country name), Add Handling Amount,  Add the Ceiling (the highest dollar amount that would be within the range for this price to be charged, i.e. from $0-$9.99, a person pays 7%. For $10.00-$29.99, they pay 17%, etc.), Add Charge Percentage.

===Quantity Based Shipping===
This option allows the following modes of setting up your shipping charges: Standard, Progressive.

==== Standard - based on total number of items shipped ====

You can set up a standard fee that is to be charged for the total number of items ordered. For example, you can charge $3.00 per item if there is a minimum of 3 items per order. You can set the charge at $2.00 per item if the total order is up to 6 items, and $1.75 per item if the total order is over 6 items. You could have the series go as high as you wish.

||Minimum # of Items||Charge per Item||
||3||$3.00||
||6||$2.00||
||+||$1.75||

====Progressive - based on defined ranges ====

You can set up a series of quantity ranges and charge shipping for the items that fall within the quantity range. For example, you can set up five ranges as follows: 1-3, 4-7, 8-15, +. This means that you can charge shipping progressively, the first 3 items are charged at the rate you set for that range, items 4 through 7 are charged at the rate for that range, etc. The last row has the highest range. This is the cost of items over the final range. Therefore, if you get a discount for quantity shipping, you can pass it on to your customers.

||Range of Items||Charge per Item in Range||
||1-3||$3.00||
||4-7||$2.00||
||8-15||$1.50||
||+||$1.00||


====A comparison:====

If you shipped 10 items using each method, the charges are shown below.

====Standard Method====
The charge for 10 items is $1.75 per item, or $17.50 total.

====Progressive Method====
Charge for the first three items is $3.00 per item, or $9.00 for this range of items.
Charge for next four items is $2.00 per item, or $8.00 for this range of items.
Charge for next three item (8, 9, 10) is $1.50 per item, or $4.50 for this range of items.
The total charge is the total of the three ranges: $9.00+$8.00+$4.50=$21.50.


===Weight Table Based Shipping===
The Weight Table Based Shipping allows you to create pre–configured, custom Shipping Methods.

    * After configuring this shipping module, all your products will have the tab (link) Weight Table Shipping Charges. The charge field allows you to add or subtract an amount from the pre-configured table shipping rates for that product.
    * You can define a Handling charge for the shipping method. This charge is in addition to the amount specified in the weight table. This is handy when you are entering weight and rate information directly from a shipper 's rate table, but need to add a charge to cover the cost of packaging.
    * Each line in the table has a ceiling to define a top range for the weight.
    * The ceiling is the highest weight that qualifies for that row. For example, if you charge $4 shipping for orders up to 2 lbs., then the ceiling for the first row would be 2.  

===Row Cost Ceiling===

||Row||Cost||Ceiling||
||1||$4.00||2||
||2||$5.00||4||
||3||$6.00||+||

 

    * Each line in the table has a rate for shipping a product that weighs less than the ceiling weight.
    * The last row should define the highest amount charged. Its ceiling is a +.
    * The rate is the amount you want to charge for shipping. This does not include the handling charge you may enter.
