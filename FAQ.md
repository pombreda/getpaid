**Can I use buildout on MS Windows? Answer: Probably not, many of the packages are not supported there at this time.**

**Why isn't there a button to "add to cart" under something I made "buyable"? Answer: We don't change your template by default with GetPaid. We use a portlet that appears in the right column to show the product details, price, and "add to cart" link.**
